# Cloud-Computing-with-RECS
AWS deployment of machine learning models and web visualizations of residential energy consumption data from the Energy Information Administration.

This repository includes data from the 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) administered by EIA (https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2015/).

The 'Modeling' folding includes python scripts for training a simple multi-layer perceptron to predict the energy consumption of a household given its consumption characteristics.

The 'Website' folder contains HTML files and data for an interactive website. All aspects were built to be hosted on Amazon Web Services including S3 and EC2. A brief slideshow summarizes the implementation.
